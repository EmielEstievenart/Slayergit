# SlayerGit Example Code

This folder contains non-functional skeleton code examples that demonstrate the project structure and component organization.

**⚠️ Important:** This code is for **reference only**. It is:
- Non-compiling
- Contains placeholders and stubs
- Simplified to show structure, not full implementation
- Meant to be copied and adapted, not used directly

## What's Here

### `basic-skeleton/`

Complete UI skeleton for **Vertical Slice 01: UI Panels and Navigation**.

Shows:
- Window and tab organization
- Event handling patterns
- Layout structure with FTXUI
- Numbered window navigation

**How to Use:**
1. Review the code to understand structure
2. Copy relevant files to your `src/` directory
3. Adapt and expand with real implementations
4. See `docs/slices/01-ui-panels-navigation.md` for full implementation guide

## Why Examples Folder?

1. **Saves Context:** Keeps the architecture doc focused on concepts, not code
2. **Living Reference:** Code that evolves with the project
3. **Onboarding:** New contributors can see concrete structure
4. **Experimentation:** Try ideas without polluting main codebase

## Adding New Examples

When creating new vertical slices:
1. Create a new folder: `examples/<slice-name>/`
2. Add relevant skeleton files
3. Reference from the slice document
4. Keep code minimal and focused on the slice goal
